### {Jake Asiddao}

- {Jake clicked went through the first task quickly and found the Sale Price.}
- {Jake had a bit of trouble getting through the second task. He tried clicking on the small promos to recieve further details on a product and it didn't work. Didn't get to the thank you message by first route had to go to product details on Skis.}
- {He wondered why there was no buttons on snowboards}
- {Jake tried clicking on the product image to recieve more information on product details. But it didn't work. Jake also went directly to the type on the products page to click the link unexpecting that he could have clicked on the actual product. Jake noticed that the Product details button was not unified with the rest of the look and feel of the layout. Jake thought that the Salomon Suspect Ski was the Salomon Pro Pipe}

## Trends

### Critical, Needs Fixing, Unable to Complete

- {Everyone assumed that the brand name was the product. Snowboard search results product page needs button for links.}
- etc.

### Serious, Causes Frustration, May Hinder Completion

- {Two participants noticed that the small promos are not clickable. Products Details Page and Add to cart page shpould be combined into one page.}
- etc.

### Minor, Annoying, Wonâ€™t Hinder Completion

- {Reviews need a link on them. Some images need hover states so that they are more obvious that they can be clicked on.}
- etc.
